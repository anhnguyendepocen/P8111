title: "Linear Regression Models"
---

This page is a repository of my old lecture notes for P8111 (linear regression models). 

The aim of this course was to provide training in both the theoretical foundations and the practical use of linear regression models. It was targeted to MS/MPH and PhD students who have some data analysis experience in applied linear regression. This course was offered in the Spring semester, 2013-2016, through the Biostatistics Department at the Columbia School of Public Health.
